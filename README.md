Notely is a backoffice extension plugin which allows you to add notes to content nodes. You can see it like the `Trello for Umbraco`. At one side Notely is a new property editor which you can use in different ways:

- You can wrap Notely around your existing property editors
- You can define a Notely type without an existing property editor

#### PRO TIP!!!

One thing I would like to mention is, don't wrap Notely around all your properties of all your content nodes.
